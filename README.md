# Timestamp Microservice

This is project #1 of the freeCodeCamp Backend Development Certification Syllabus.

## Objective

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/> and deploy it to Glitch.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit <https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects>.

## User Stories

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

  *  I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
  * If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
  * If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

## On Completion

Click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Glitch.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
